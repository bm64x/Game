    <p style="height: 100px; width: 900px;border-style: groove;">Cracked games are video games that have been modified to remove or bypass their copy protection or digital rights management (DRM) systems.
     This is usually done by hackers or groups who aim to allow users to play the game without purchasing it legally. Cracked games are often distributed on unauthorized websites or through file-sharing networks. While some people use them to avoid paying for games, downloading and using cracked games is illegal and can expose users to security risks such as malware, viruses, or spyware hidden in the files.
     Additionally, using cracked games can result in a lack of access to updates, online features, or support from the official developers.</p>

     <h3>Pirating games is illegal in most country and not a save option to download any game cause of getting virus and non official copies of the base game </h3>
     <h2>What Is Pirating Games</h2>
     <br>
     <p style="height: 170px; width: 900px;border-style: groove;">People pirate games for a variety of reasons, and while its illegal and often risky, some individuals justify it based on personal circumstances or beliefs.
         One common reason is financial limitation—many gamers, especially students or people in countries with weaker economies, simply cannot afford the high prices of new games, particularly when they are released at premium costs. Others pirate games to test them before deciding whether to purchase, especially if there’s no official demo or refund policy available. Some do it because the game isn’t available in their region due to regional restrictions or censorship, making piracy the only way to access it. In certain cases, players are frustrated with companies that include aggressive DRM systems that affect performance or privacy, so they turn to cracked versions that remove those limitations. There’s also a portion of the community that sees game piracy as a way of preserving older titles that are no longer sold or supported.
         Despite these justifications, pirating games is still illegal, and it comes with significant risks, including exposure to malware, lack of updates, online bans, and ethical concerns about not supporting the developers who worked on the game.</p>
